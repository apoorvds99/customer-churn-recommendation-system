# Customer Churn Prediction & Recommendation System

## Overview
This project predicts which customers are likely to churn and recommends the most profitable retention action using machine learning.

The system not only predicts churn but also suggests what the company should do to retain each customer.

---

## Key Features
- Churn prediction using ML models
- Customer value estimation
- Retention strategy recommendation
- Profit-based decision logic

---

## How it Works
1. The model predicts churn probability.
2. Customer value is estimated.
3. Different retention actions are simulated.
4. The action with the highest expected profit is recommended.

If no action is profitable, the system recommends **No Action**.
